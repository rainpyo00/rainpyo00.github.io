        <p>Hey there! I'm excited to share this website I created for my Advanced Marking and Scripting class. 
        It's still a work in progress, but when finished, the site will showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        If you're interested in learning more about me and my background, head on over to my introduction page by clicking 
        <a href="introduction.html">here!</a></p>
