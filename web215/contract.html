        <h2>CONTRACT</h2>
        <p class="contract_p">
            I, <a href="introduction.html">&nbsp;Rain Pyo&nbsp;</a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2024, WEB215, Advanced Markup and Scripting class  with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
<br>Signed:<br><em> Rain Pyo , 15/01/2024</em>
